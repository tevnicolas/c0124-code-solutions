## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are objects used for?
  Used to store keyed collections of various data and complex entities.

- What are object properties?
  A property has a key name before the colon and a value to the right of it. They makeup the data in objects.

- Describe object literal notation.
  Declaring an object using curly bracket notation {...}.

- How do you remove a property from an object?
  Use the delete operator.

- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
  By using dot notation or bracket notation.

- What is the purpose of interfaces in TypeScript?
  Interfaces fill the role of naming types, for example "duck typing" and "structural typing". They are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.

- How do optional properties in a TypeScript interface differ from mandatory properties, and why are they useful?
  Interfaces with optional properties are written similar to other interfaces, with each optional property denoted by a ? at the end of the property name in the declaration. The advantage of optional properties is that you can describe these possibly available properties while still also preventing use of properties that are not part of the interface.
