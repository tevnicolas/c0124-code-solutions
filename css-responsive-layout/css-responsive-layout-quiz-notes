## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
a specific point at which the website's content and layout will adjust to accommodate different screen sizes, resolutions, or aspect ratios.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
The columns will always stay a relative % size of any varying screen size.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
When you have multiple rules that could apply to the same element, the rules that come later in the stylesheet will take precedence over earlier ones.
