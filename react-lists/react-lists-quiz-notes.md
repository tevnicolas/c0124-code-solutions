  So that the appropriate amount of tags are created for the referenced data set.

  Reusability, usually more efficient code, dynamic rendering of content.

- Where in the component code would a list of React components typically be built?
  In the body of the component code, prior to return statement.

- What `Array` method is commonly used to create a list of React components?
  The .map()

- Why do components in a list need to have unique keys?
