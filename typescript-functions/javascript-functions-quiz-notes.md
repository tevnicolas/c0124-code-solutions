## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is packaged up code that can be named and reused throughout a program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword to begin the creation of a new function.
  An optional name. (Our function's name is sayHello.)
  A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses. (Our sayHello function doesn't have any parameters.)
  The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace.
  An optional return statement. (Our sayHello function doesn't have a return statement.)
  The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The name of the function and parentheses next to it. Within the parenthesis are optional arguments separated by commas.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The function definition is more lines of code usually and outlines a function.
  The function call is usually a single line and just calls the function.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is used in a function definition and anticipates data whereas an argument is passed in as data through a function call.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are useful because they describe what kind of data can be passed in the function. They are like variables and can be manipulated according to the functions contents.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

1. Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
2. Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
