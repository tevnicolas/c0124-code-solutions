## Write Up

<!--- Final project write up goes here --->

There's one major aspect of my project that is still incomplete, one which feels worthwhile to implement before presenting publicly. Basically this issue is the lack of a mobile friendly interface. Because my app requires inputting text and viewing that text elsewhere on the screen, it was hard to account for how mobile devices will focus on a certain point of the screen, as compared to desktop devices where the whole screen is consistently visible. For example, my app needs to behave more like a messages app, where the keyboard comes up half way, and the top half of the screen shows a conversation. I found it was challenging to develop for this using the desktop Chrome browser's mobile tools, as it hard to approximate the behaviors I just explained. My plan is to spend the next week focusing on redesigning my mobile side, using resources like this page https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-disable-zoom-on-a-mobile-web-page-using-html-and-css.html to navigate around the default mobile zoom functionality and create a more usable interface.
