## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let, const, or var keyword before the name of the variable you wish to declare.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  We can put some data into a variable by using the assignment operator = 'value'

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and \_.
  The first character must not be a digit.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  Capitalization when naming or calling the variable matters.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
  This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  It is an assignment operator. It is used to assign value to a variable.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  By assigning new value with an assignment operator, without re-declaring.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  a null value represents a reference that points, generally intentionally, to a nonexistent or invalid object or address. Where as undefined is a value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?

For clarity.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.

1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. undefined
5. null
